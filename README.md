## Hi there 👋

I'm an aerospace engineering undergraduate at The University of Sheffield, focusing on flight controls. I'm currently developing my skills in C++ and embedded systems for my future career.

## 🚀 Projects

### MarsWorks Rover LED Controller
* **Description:** As an Electronics Engineer on the MarsWorks team, I'm designing and building a competition-compliant LED control system. My work involves the full engineering design cycle: from simulating and validating a robust MOSFET driver circuit in LTspice to designing the final, ERC-passed KiCad schematic. The system is controlled by an ATtiny85 microcontroller programmed in C++.
* **Status:** `Repository is currently private` to comply with team and competition rules.

### Aerofoil-Analysis-Tool
* **Description:** A simple Python script for basic aerofoil analysis. This was a quick personal project from summer 2025 to experiment with core aerodynamic concepts.
* **Status:** `Complete.` This repository is archived as my primary development focus has shifted to C/C++ for embedded systems and flight controls.

## 📚 I'm currently learning ...
* **C++:** Building a strong foundation for embedded systems and real-time applications.
* **CUDA:** Exploring parallel computing for high-performance aerospace simulations.
* **KiCad:** Translating circuit simulations into manufacturable PCB designs.
